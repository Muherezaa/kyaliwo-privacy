    <h1>Kyali wo Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: February 18, 2026</p>
    
    <p>Kyali wo is a free app for discovering and sharing local Ugandan food spots, built by Joshua Muhereza (@DuskRavn). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This policy explains how we collect, use, and share data.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: With your permission, we access your device's location to show nearby food vendors. This is used only for app functionality and is not stored long-term.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos and Media</strong>: When adding vendors or menu items, you may upload images from your device. These are stored securely on Firebase and displayed publicly in the app.</li>
        <li><strong>User Content</strong>: Details like vendor names, addresses, phones, and chats are collected when you submit them. We use Firebase Authentication for sign-in (if chatting or adding).</li>
        <li><strong>Device Info</strong>: Basic data like app version and device type for troubleshooting—no personal identifiers.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide core features: Showing nearby spots, enabling chats/calls, and community additions.</li>
        <li>To improve the app: Anonymous analytics via Firebase to fix bugs and enhance discovery.</li>
        <li>We do NOT sell your data or use it for ads.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We share data only with Firebase (our backend provider) for storage and functionality. User-added content (e.g., vendor details) is public in the app. We may disclose info if required by law.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Disable location in device settings (app will use defaults like Kampala).</li>
        <li>Delete your account/data: Contact us via X.</li>
        <li>For EU/UK users: GDPR rights apply—request access/deletion.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use Firebase's security features, but no system is perfect. Report issues to us.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Not intended for under 13—parents, contact us if needed.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We'll update here and notify in-app for big changes.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For questions: <a href="https://x.com/DuskRavn">@DuskRavn on X</a> or email duskravn@example.com (replace with your real email).</p>
